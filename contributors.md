Okay, that makes perfect sense. I will create the entire CONTRIBUTORS.md file for you, formatted in Markdown, that you can directly add to your GitHub repository.

I've included detailed descriptions of each person's contribution based on the papers you provided and our previous conversations. This will be a great, organized record for your project.

CONTRIBUTORS
We would like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of the following individuals to the Collatz-Box-Universes project.

Ramon Carbó-Dorca: Provided foundational insights into generalizing Collatz sequences with prime number constraints (X, Y, Z) based on his theoretical framework of Natural Numbers Parity Extension.

Mehmet Keçeci: Contributed the correct implementation of the "Keçeci Numbers" algorithm, a valuable addition that was previously a source of error.

Enis Olgac: Developed a method for encoding the topology of directed trees and graphs using "linear footprints." This is essential for the toolkit's ability to efficiently visualize and analyze the structure of the sequences it generates.

Anant Gupta: Authored the "Rotating Binaries" algorithm, which provides a novel way to analyze generalized Collatz sequences through the properties of binary numbers.
