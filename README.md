# Collatz-box-universesBox Universe ExplorerLong-Term Mission StatementThis project aims to explore and visualize generalized Collatz sequences from novel perspectives. Each unique sequence, contained within its 9-net visualization, represents a distinct "Box Universe." The goal is to build intuitive tools and models (like 9-nets and the data slicer) that reveal hidden patterns, behaviors, and relationships within the multi-dimensional parameter space (N, X, Y, Z) that defines these universes. This approach, stemming from an "outsider" perspective, seeks to provide a unique "visual intuition" and new context for the Collatz problem, potentially inspiring new hypotheses and facilitating deeper understanding.Key FeaturesYour Box Universe Explorer is composed of two primary applications, each designed to provide a distinct approach to understanding generalized Collatz sequences:index.html (Box Universe Explorer - Quantitative Analysis Tool)This application is dedicated to the detailed, step-by-step examination of a single Box Universe.Customizable Generalized Collatz Rules: Input specific parameters for N (starting number), X (divisor), Y (multiplier), and Z (adder) to define your unique Box Universe.Step-by-Step Sequence Generation: Observe the exact numerical progression of the sequence, step by step, as it evolves.Interactive 9-Net Visualization: A dynamic 3x3 grid (the "9-net") visually represents the sequence, with each square corresponding to a step.Color-Coded Steps: Distinguish between "divisible" steps (N/X) and "multiply-add" steps (N*Y+Z) for immediate qualitative insight into the rule applied.Number Truncation: Large numbers within the 9-net squares are gracefully truncated with an ellipsis (...) for readability, while retaining their full value in the sequence history.Sequence History Display: A comprehensive list of all numbers generated in the sequence, up to convergence or a defined limit.Cycle Detection: Automatically identifies and highlights if and when a sequence enters a cycle.Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Safety Barrier: Prevents calculations from exceeding JavaScript's safe integer limit, ensuring data integrity.Customizable Colors: Personalize the colors for divisible and multiply-add steps to suit your visual preferences.slicer.html (2D Pseudo-3D Slicer - Qualitative Exploration Tool)This application provides a dynamic, multi-view approach to exploring the vast parameter space of Box Universes, helping to build visual intuition and identify broad patterns.Multi-Universe Display: Simultaneously visualize multiple 9-nets based on user-defined ranges for N, X, Y, and Z.Parameter Range Filtering: Define specific minimum and maximum values for N, X, Y, and Z to focus your exploration on particular regions of the parameter space.Dynamic Slideshow Exploration: Animate through the parameter space by continuously varying one chosen parameter (N, X, Y, or Z) while holding others constant.Adjustable Playback Speed: Control the pace of the animation to observe changes at your preferred rate.Axis Selection: Easily switch which parameter is being animated to explore different dimensions of the Box Universe space.Visual Pattern Recognition: Designed to help users quickly identify visual trends, similarities, and anomalies across many Box Universes as parameters change.Clear 9-Net Presentation: Each 9-net maintains the color-coding and number truncation features for consistent visual cues.Customizable Colors: Personalize the colors for divisible and multiply-add steps.
