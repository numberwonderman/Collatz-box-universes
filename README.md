Collatz Box Universes Explorer Suite
Long-Term Mission Statement
This project aims to explore and visualize generalized Collatz sequences from novel, multi-dimensional perspectives. Moving beyond single-sequence analysis, the goal is to reveal the intricate tapestry of patterns, behaviors, and relationships that define vast "Box Universes." By providing intuitive, multi-level tools and models (like 9-nets, 2D parameter slicers, and 3D spatial explorers), this approach seeks to offer a unique "visual intuition" and fresh context for the Collatz problem. Through the synthesis of information across different visualization "lenses," the project intends to inspire new hypotheses, facilitate deeper understanding, and unlock insights that no single perspective could reveal alone.
The Generalized Collatz Rule
The core of this project revolves around a generalized Collatz function:
For any number n:
If n \pmod{X} = 0, then n \to n / X
Otherwise, n \to (n \cdot Y) + Z
(The standard Collatz conjecture uses X=2, Y=3, Z=1)
Exploring the Box Universe: A Multi-Level Perspective (LOD)
Your Box Universe Explorer suite is composed of eight distinct applications, each designed to provide a unique and complementary "Level of Detail" (LOD) or perspective for understanding generalized Collatz sequences. Together, they form a powerful toolkit for comprehensive exploration:
Highest Level (Rule-Set Overview): box-universe-viewer.html (Box Universe Viewer)
Focus: Understanding the global behavior of different Collatz rules (X,Y,Z) when applied to a single fixed starting number (N).
Visualization: A 3D grid where each cube represents a unique rule-set, color-coded to indicate its overall outcome (convergence, divergence, cycles, or classic Collatz).
Insight: Discover broad patterns in the properties of the rules themselves, identifying regions of stability, chaos, or specific cyclic behaviors across the parameter space.
Intermediate Level (Rule-Set Iteration & Comparison): slicer.html (2D Pseudo-3D Slicer)
Focus: Systematically comparing many different Collatz rules by generating and displaying their corresponding 2D 9-net sequence visualizations in a grid or slideshow.
Visualization: Creates a dynamic grid or slideshow of multiple 2D 9-nets, where each 9-net depicts a sequence's path for a distinct (N, X, Y, Z) rule combination from user-defined ranges.
Insight: Build visual intuition and identify trends as rule parameters are varied, allowing for rapid comparison of sequence patterns across a slice of the rule space.
Deep Level (Number Space Exploration): box-universe-fps.html (Box Universe FPS)
Focus: Immersive exploration of the 3D number space for a single, fixed Collatz rule.
Visualization: Constructs a 3D cube grid where each cube represents a unique number. Cubes are initially colored by parity (even/odd). You can navigate this space using FPS controls, interactively slice through layers, and animate the sequence path of a clicked number directly within the 3D grid.
Insight: Understand the spatial distribution of number properties and observe how sequences dynamically "travel" or "flow" through this abstract 3D representation of numbers.
Specific Sequence Detail & History: index.html (Box Universe Explorer)
Focus: Detailed analysis of individual generalized Collatz sequences and maintaining a history of these calculations.
Visualization: Displays a single sequence's numerical progression and its path on a 2D 9-net canvas, along with comprehensive statistical properties (steps, min/max, sum, average, std dev). It also logs a history of generated sequences, each with its own 9-net.
Insight: Provides granular quantitative analysis and a 2D visual record of an individual sequence's journey under a specified rule.
Geometric/Fractal LOD: collatz-dragon.html (Collatz Dragon Explorer)
Focus: Revealing the hidden geometric and fractal properties inherent in Collatz sequences by transforming sequence operations into a visual path.
Visualization: Generates a 2D fractal "Dragon Curve" based on the binary path of a sequence's operations (divisible by X vs. multiply/add).
Insight: Offers an artistic and abstract perspective on sequence behavior, emphasizing geometric self-similarity and recursive patterns.
Dynamic Geometric Trajectory LOD: collatz-line-explorer.html (Collatz Line Universe Explorer)
Focus: Visualizing the dynamic, step-by-step 3D geometric progression of a single Collatz sequence as an evolving line.
Visualization: Creates a dynamic 3D line (or point trail) where the geometry itself embodies the sequence's progression and the type of Collatz operation at each step. The line "draws itself" over time with different colors for step types.
Insight: Provides a qualitative and abstract view of how sequences "draw themselves" through a 3D space, showing unique "signatures" for each sequence.
Radial/Cyclic LOD: radial-animator.html (2D Pseudo-3D Slicer - Radial Animator)
Focus: Animating the progression of a Collatz sequence as a radial graph, emphasizing cyclic patterns and modular relationships.
Visualization: Displays numbers on a circular path based on their value modulo a chosen number, with lines connecting successive elements in the sequence. The visualization animates the sequence step-by-step.
Insight: Highlights how numbers distribute and transition within modular arithmetic, revealing potential cycles and attractors in a dynamic, radial format.
Radial/Cyclic LOD: radial-viewer.html (Radial Viewer)
Focus: Providing a static or single-sequence view of the radial representation of a Collatz sequence.
Visualization: Plots numbers on a circle based on their value modulo a chosen number, with lines connecting the sequence steps, similar to radial-animator.html but without the continuous animation.
Insight: Offers a clear, concise view of the modular distribution and path of a specific sequence for focused analysis.
