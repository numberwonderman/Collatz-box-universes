Collatz Box Universes Explorer Suite
Long-Term Mission Statement
This project aims to explore and visualize generalized Collatz sequences from novel, multi-dimensional perspectives. Moving beyond single-sequence analysis, the goal is to reveal the intricate tapestry of patterns, behaviors, and relationships that define vast "Box Universes." By providing intuitive, multi-level tools and models (like 9-nets, 2D parameter slicers, and 3D spatial explorers), this approach seeks to offer a unique "visual intuition" and fresh context for the Collatz problem. Through the synthesis of information across different visualization "lenses," the project intends to inspire new hypotheses, facilitate deeper understanding, and unlock insights that no single perspective could reveal alone.

Exploring the Box Universe: A Multi-Level Perspective (LOD)
Your Box Universe Explorer suite is composed of six distinct applications, each designed to provide a unique and complementary "Level of Detail" (LOD) or perspective for understanding generalized Collatz sequences. Together, they form a powerful toolkit for comprehensive exploration:

Highest Level (Rule-Set Overview): box-universe-viewer.html (Box Universe Viewer)

Focus: Understanding the global behavior of different Collatz rules (X,Y,Z) when applied to a single fixed starting number (N).

Visualization: A 3D grid where each cube represents a unique rule-set, color-coded to indicate its overall outcome (convergence, divergence, cycles, or classic Collatz).

Insight: Discover broad patterns in the properties of the rules themselves, identifying regions of stability, chaos, or specific cyclic behaviors across the parameter space.

Intermediate Level (Rule-Set Iteration & Comparison): slicer.html (2D Pseudo-3D Slicer)

Focus: Systematically comparing many different Collatz rules by generating and displaying their corresponding 2D 9-net sequence visualizations in a grid or slideshow.

Visualization: Creates a dynamic grid or slideshow of multiple 2D 9-nets, where each 9-net depicts a sequence's path for a distinct (N, X, Y, Z) rule combination from user-defined ranges.

Insight: Build visual intuition and identify trends as rule parameters are varied, allowing for rapid comparison of sequence patterns across a slice of the rule space.

Deep Level (Number Space Exploration): slicer3d.html (Box Universe FPS)

Focus: Immersive exploration of the 3D number space for a single, fixed Collatz rule.

Visualization: Constructs a 3D cube grid where each cube represents a unique number. Cubes are initially colored by parity (even/odd). You can navigate this space using FPS controls, interactively slice through layers, and animate the sequence path of a clicked number directly within the 3D grid.

Insight: Understand the spatial distribution of number properties and observe how sequences dynamically "travel" or "flow" through this abstract 3D representation of numbers.

Specific Sequence Detail & History: index.html (Box Universe Explorer)

Focus: Detailed analysis of individual generalized Collatz sequences and maintaining a history of these calculations.

Visualization: Displays a single sequence's numerical progression and its path on a 2D 9-net canvas, along with comprehensive statistical properties (steps, min/max, sum, average, std dev). It also logs a history of generated sequences, each with its own 9-net.

Insight: Provides granular quantitative analysis and a 2D visual record of an individual sequence's journey under a specified rule.

Geometric/Fractal LOD: collatz-dragon.html (Collatz Dragon Explorer)

Focus: Revealing the hidden geometric and fractal properties inherent in Collatz sequences by transforming sequence operations into a visual path.

Visualization: Generates a 2D fractal "Dragon Curve" based on the binary path of a sequence's operations (divisible by X vs. multiply/add).

Insight: Offers an artistic and abstract perspective on sequence behavior, emphasizing geometric self-similarity and recursive patterns.

Dynamic Geometric Trajectory LOD: collatz-line-explorer.html (Collatz Line Universe Explorer)

Focus: Visualizing the dynamic, step-by-step 3D geometric progression of a single Collatz sequence as an evolving line.

Visualization: Creates a dynamic 3D line (or point trail) where the geometry itself embodies the sequence's progression and the type of Collatz operation at each step. The line "draws itself" over time with different colors for step types.

Insight: Provides a qualitative and abstract view of how sequences "draw themselves" through a 3D space, showing unique "signatures" for each sequence.

Planned Features / Conceptual Design (Future LOD Integration):

This section outlines the vision for how slicer3d.html will evolve to support a more explicit multi-level exploration. The goal is to allow users to zoom in from a high-level "ruleset grid" to this detailed "number grid" view.

Hierarchical Exploration (Transition from Rule-Set View):

Level 1 (External - box-universe-viewer.html): The initial entry would ideally be the box-universe-viewer.html which displays a 3D grid of rulesets.

Level 2 (Internal - Current slicer3d.html functionality): Upon selecting/clicking a "ruleset cube" from the Level 1 view, the user would seamlessly transition to this slicer3d.html application, which then renders a detailed 3D grid where each cube represents a specific number under the chosen ruleset.

Advanced Deep-Linking & Interaction (Planned):

Direct Ruleset Highlight: URL parameters could directly highlight a specific "ruleset cube" in the initial box-universe-viewer.html view upon page load, then transition to slicer3d.html.

Auto-Sequence Animation: URL parameters could automatically trigger the sequence animation for a specified number-cube within the 3D number grid view upon page load, facilitating sharing of specific discoveries.
